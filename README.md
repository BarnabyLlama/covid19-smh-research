# COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub - Research


This repository follows the guidelines and standards outlined by the hubverse, 
which provides a set of data formats and open source tools for modeling hubs.

The Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs. The hubverse: open tools for 
collaborative modeling. GitHub release v2.0.0, 14 Jul 2023. URL: https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs

## How to participate    

The Scenario Modeling Hub is open to any team willing to provide projections
at the right temporal and spatial scales, with minimal gatekeeping. We only 
require that participating teams share point estimates and uncertainty bounds, 
along with a short model description and answers to a list of key questions 
about design. A major output of the projection hub is ensemble estimates of 
epidemic outcomes (e.g., infection, hospitalizations, and deaths), for different
time points, intervention scenarios, and US jurisdictions.

Those interested to participate, please read the README file and email us at 
scenariohub@midasnetwork.us 


## Target Data

The repository contains a [target-data](./target-data/) folder relevant to the modeling efforts.
It contains COVID-19 case and death time series by race/ethnicity. 

For more information, please consult the associated [README file](./target-data/README.md)

## Auxiliary Data

An additional repository containing the auxiliary data is available on GitHub: 
[covid19-smh-research_resources](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-smh-research_resources).
This repository contains additional code and data that are relevant to the 
modeling efforts. 


## Data license and reuse

All source code that is specific to the overall project is available under an 
open-source [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). We note that 
this license does NOT cover model code from the various teams, model scenario 
data (available under specified licenses as described above) and auxiliary data.

## Computational power

Those teams interested in accessing additional computational power should 
contact Katriona Shea at k-shea@psu.edu. Additional resources might be available 
from the [MIDAS Coordination Center](https://midasnetwork.us/) - please 
contact questions@midasnetwork.us for information.
