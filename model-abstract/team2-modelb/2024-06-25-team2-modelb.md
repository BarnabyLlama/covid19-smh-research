## Summary of results given model assumptions? 
FILL

## Distribution of susceptibility at the start of the projection period? 
FILL

## Which disease datasets (serology, cases, cases with imputed race/ethnicity information provided by coordination team, hospitalizations, deaths) were used for calibration? 
FILL

## How were the transmission (P(infection)) and severity (P(death|infection) risks estimated across racial/ethnic groups? 
FILL

## How was the suppression of deaths handled in calibration? 
FILL

## Details about calibration of race/ethnicity showing zero deaths throughout the calibration period (e.g., Others in CA and Asian in NC)? 
FILL

## How was contact mixing between racial/ethnic groups characterized? Was a contact matrix (either population-level or setting-specific) used? If so, describe the process used to apply the contact matrix.)
FILL

## Was mobility data used throughout the calibration/projection period? 
FILL

## Besides transmission, severity risk and contact matrices, did any other parameters vary by race/ethnicity (e.g., case reporting, NPI compliance)? 
FILL

## How was the introduction of more transmissible variants modeled? 
FILL

## How were NPIs implemented? 
FILL

## What was assumed about immunity/protection following infection? 
FILL

## How was vaccination implemented? What was assumed about immunity/protection following vaccination? 
FILL

## Was age modeled in addition to race/ethnicity? Was there consideration for differences in the age structure across racial/ethnic populations? 
FILL

## Was there importation of cases (e.g. from another external state)?
